# Bowling Game Scoreboard Controller

## Problem Statement

Imagine youâ€™re tasked with writing the software for a bowling alley that shows the bowling game scoreboard.
Design entities and interfaces to model a scoreboard controller for bowling, keeping in mind the nature of the input from the physical machinery in the bowling lane, which generally reflects pin state.
The input to the scoreboard controller is the lane control hardware that reflects the pin state (i.e. how many pins are up/down).

## Task

Using your design, implement (in the programming language of your choosing) the scoring / game state display service that would compute needed data that one typically expects to see on the lane monitor during a game.
Rules of bowling scoring are 'http://bowling.about.com/od/rulesofthegame/a/bowlingscoring.htm'.
If you need additional information, there is also more scoring here ('http://slocums.homestead.com/gamescore.html'), but this gets into more complicated areas like fouls, splits, etc.

## Setup

This repository has been written in Cloud9 development environment.
It can be cloned at 'https://c9.io/tonnamb/bowling_game'.

If cloning through GitHub is preferred, please execute these commands:

    $ git clone https://github.com/tonnamb/bowling_game.git
    $ cd bowling_game
    $ npm install

## Technologies

* JavaScript ES6
* Mocha, Chai (test-driven development, behavior-driven syntax)
* webpack (modules bundler, babel-loader)
* babel (transpile ES6 into ES5)
* static `express` server

## Design of "BowlingGame" class

* One game entity per player
* A game has 10 frames
* A frame has one or two rolls
* The tenth frame has two or three rolls
* The score for a spare or a strike depends on the frames successor

## Requirements & Implementation Details

Write class "BowlingGame" with public methods:

### constructor(player)

* set player to this.playerName
* if player is not passed, set this.playerName = 'John' by default
* initialize game entity

### this.roll(pins)

Figure 1: Pins bottom-up labelling convention

![Pins](http://www.clker.com/cliparts/O/6/o/5/Z/5/bowling-pins-diagram-md.png)

* called each time the player rolls a ball.
* pins: { 1: true, 2: false, ... }
  * labeled bottom-up as Figure 1
  * true = standing up, false = knocked down
  * reflects the lane control hardware
  * throw error if pins object is not passed
* does nothing if end of game
  * checked using this._isEndOfGame() method
* update these object properties:
  * this.pinsBefore and this.pinsAfter
    * used to calculate score of the roll with this._comparePins()
    * this._comparePins() throw error if a pin stands back up after being knocked down
  * this.score
    * { frameIndex: { rollIndex: rollScore, cumScore: #}, ... }
    * e.g. {1: {1: 10, cumScore: 20}, 2: {1: 7, 2: 3, cumScore: 37}, 3: {1: 7, 2: 0, cumScore: 44}, 4: {cumScore: 44}}
    * update using this._calcScore()
    * takes care of spare and strike bonuses by logic inside this._calcScore(): 
      * enable bonus flags when strike or spare (this._boolStrikeBonus1, this._boolStrikeBonus2, this._boolSpareBonus), which is tested using this._isStrike() and this._isSpare()
      * add score to previous frame's cumScore if bonus flag is enabled
  * this.currentFrame and this.currentRoll
    * current frame = player is going to roll in this frame next
    * current roll = player is going to roll this ball next
    * these information are required for this._calcScore()
    * logic is slightly different for 10th frame, i.e. next frame score and pinsData are not initialized after end of frame
  * this.pinsData
    * stores pins object for each roll
    * useful for future implementation of method for modifying scores

### this.writeScoreBoard()

* for rendering in the front-end
* returns a JavaScript object with a scoreboard format as shown in Figure 2
* { frameIndex: { rollIndex: 'rollScore', cumScore: '#'}, ... }
* e.g. {1: {1: '', 2: 'X', cumScore: '20'}, 2: {1: '7', 2: '/', cumScore: '37'}, 3: {1: '7', 2: '-', cumScore: '44'}}
* strike = 'X' in the second roll box
  * hides cumScore if two next rolls does not yet exist
* spare = '/'
  * hides cumScore if next ball is not rolled yet
* gutter = '-'
  * using this._zeroOrNum(score, frame, roll)
* hides cumScore if not all balls are rolled in the frame
* in the 10th frame, logic is slightly more complex
  * 'X' can appear on all 3 rolls
  * '/' can appear on the 2nd and 3rd roll
* does not return empty frames where the game has not reached those frames yet
  * benefit = requires less data transmission to front-end
  * drawback = handling logic required in the front-end

## Running tests

    $ npm test

## Compile public/app.bundle.js

    $ npm run webpack-dev

## Running the server

    $ npm start

If running from Cloud9, view project at 'https://bowling-game-tonnamb.c9users.io/'. (Replace 'tonnamb' with your Cloud9 username)
Otherwise, the public files are served at 'http://localhost:8080/'.

Currently, this is just a blank page with console.log('Loading app.js').

## To-do

* check if split occurred
* alert front-end if spare, strike or split have occurred, such that front-end can play the spare, strike or split videos
* interface for indication of fouls and scores re-calculation accordingly
* interface for modifying scores, in the case that the physical pin state sensor fails and the player can correct their score
